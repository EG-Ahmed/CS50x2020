# Harvard CS50x2020
I made this repository to post my solutions to Harvard University's <a href='https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science'>2020 CS50 introduction to computer science</a> exercises and document my progress during the course. <br>
You can find the materials for the course <a href='https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/'>here</a>

I've finished the CS50x and got my certificate on 22 March 2020 from <a href='https://certificates.cs50.io/'>CS50 Certificate</a> and <a href='https://certificates.cs50.io/121de386-e775-4c9b-8c56-80abf78dc1a1.pdf?size=A4'>HERE</a> is my Certificate!
